## Overview

The **Antenna Radiation Mapper** is a versatile tool for mapping antenna radiation patterns with high precision. This project provides an affordable solution for testing antennas, including parabolic reflectors, offering a straightforward setup and simple operation. The system combines automated data collection, precise antenna movement, and easy connectivity, making it ideal for both enthusiasts and professionals looking for an effective antenna testing tool.

Note: This project does not include signal processing features, as they are part of a separate project that cannot be disclosed. Feel free to implement your own signal processing methods if needed.

## Key Features

- **Precision Control:** Rotate the antenna with 0.01-degree accuracy.
- **Automated Measurements:** Handle sampling, gain calculations, and graph generation.
- **Connectivity:** Connect over WiFi or serial port for data collection.
- **Modular Design:** Easily swap antennas for testing different configurations.

## Components Needed

To build your own Antenna Radiation Mapper, you will need the following components:

- **Stepper Motor:**  28BYJ-48
- **Motor Driver:** ULN2003AN
- **Microcontroller:** NodeMCU V3 (ESP8266-based)
- **Bearings:** 4 x Bearings
- **Bolts & Nuts:** 4 x M3*10 Bolts, 4 x M3 Nuts
- **Micro Switch:** 1 Micro Switch

Youâ€™ll also need to print some custom-designed 3D parts, which are provided as STL files in the repository.

## Mechanical Setup

1. **3D Print the Required Parts:** Print all parts using the STL files located in the [STL Files Folder](STL_Files).
2. **Attach Bearings:** Insert the 4 bearings into the appropriate printed parts.

## Wiring Instructions

1. **Stepper Motor Wiring:**

   - **IN1:** Connect to pin **D1** on the NodeMCU.
   - **IN2:** Connect to pin **D2** on the NodeMCU.
   - **IN3:** Connect to pin **D3** on the NodeMCU.
   - **IN4:** Connect to pin **D4** on the NodeMCU.

2. **Micro Switch Wiring:**

   - Connect the micro switch to **LIMIT\_SWITCH\_PIN (D5)** on the NodeMCU.

3. **Power Supply:**

   - Provide power to both the driver and the NodeMCU. Ensure that they **share a common ground** 

## Software Setup

1. **Download the Code:** Clone or download the code from this repository.
2. **Microcontroller Code:** Flash the C code to the NodeMCU V3 using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or the Arduino IDE.
3. **Python Script for Serial Communication:** There is a Python script available in the repository that allows you to connect via serial communication and initiate antenna movements and data recordings.

## Getting Started

1. **Power Up:** Make sure the driver, NodeMCU, and micro switch are powered properly.
2. **Connect to WiFi:** Connect to the WiFi network broadcasted by the NodeMCU. Once connected, access the control interface by navigating to **192.168.4.1** in your web browser.
3. **Initiate Testing:** Run the Python script to communicate with the NodeMCU either via WiFi or using a serial connection.
